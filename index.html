      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p>To identify and solve problems, combined with being creative and
        innovative, has always been a driving force for me. With my curiosity
        and a commitment to development, I am now seeking new challenges.<br />
        I
        value communication and collaboration as they provide opportunities for
        the exchange of experiences and expertise both internally and
        externally.
